---

## 1. Sudo cmd

- The first thing we're going to do form our cmd line is looking at how we would update our current machine.

- Just like other operating system, Linux machines requires updates as well, and patching can be best practice.

- We're going to use this command : " **sudo apt update && apt upgrade** ".

- Sometimes we have to be the root user to have the access to upgrade, we can't be just a sudo user to run this command.

- You can also install applications as a one time thing, if they're a part of the repository that you have.

## 2. git

- **git** is a tool that runs with **GitHub**.

- We can you GitHub to install tools using git command : **sudo git clone {repository Link}**.

- It is preferable to install it in the **/opt** directory.
