## Sudo Overview

---

- **Root** is the ultimate user, you could think of it as the administrator of the machine.

- Normally you open the terminal as a kali user so you don't have the privileges directly. This is considered an improved security feature because we should be running certain commands, when we need to, as the root user.

---

- We can run commands as an elevated privilege using **sudo** command (Super User Do).

- Why we use it because this user is part of what's called a **sudoers** file meaning we can have permissions.
